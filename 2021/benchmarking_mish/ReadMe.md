This folder contains the code and results for my post [Benchmarking PyTorchâ€™s Native Mish](benjaminwarner.dev/2021/07/19/benchmarking-pytorch-native-mish.html). 

The benchmark is lightly modified from Thomas Brandon's [CUDA benchmarking script](https://github.com/thomasbrandon/mish-cuda/blob/master/test/perftest.py).
