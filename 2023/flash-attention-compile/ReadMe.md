This folder contains the benchmarking code and commands for my post [FlashAttention with PyTorch Compile](/2023/08/16/flash-attention-compile.html).

To replicate, install libraries from `install.sh`, check out FlashAttention 2.0.4 and install, replacing commands to compile against Hopper's SM90 with Ampere's SM86.
